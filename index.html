<p> Soup is a primarily liquid food, generally served warm or hot (but may be cool or cold), <br>
that is made by combining ingredients of meat or vegetables with stock, milk, or water. <br>
Hot soups are additionally characterized by boiling solid ingredients in liquids in a pot until the flavors are extracted, <br>
forming a broth. Soups are similar to stews, and in some cases there may not be a clear distinction between the two; however, <br>
soups generally have more liquid (broth) than stews</p>
